Data Analysis Codebook
======================


The run_analysis script produces a new data frame containing the mean of each feature from the original feature
vector described in features_info.text. 

The first two columns of the new data frame are the Subject and the Activity identifiers, with column names
"subject" and "activity".

The new features are named by appending the string "Subject-Activity-Mean" onto the names of the original 
features. The original feature names have all dashes and parentheses replaced by a single dash. 

For example, in the new dataset the averages for the feature

tBodyAcc-mean()-X

are labeled as 

Subject-Activity-Mean-tBodyAcc-mean-X
